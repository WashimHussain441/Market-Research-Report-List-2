<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Run-flat Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Supporting</li><li>Support Ring System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The run-flat tire market comprises two main types: self-supporting and support ring systems. Self-supporting run-flat tires are designed with reinforced sidewalls that allow the tire to maintain its shape and support the vehicle's weight even when deflated. In contrast, support ring systems utilize an additional ring that fits inside the tire, providing structure and support when air pressure is lost. Both types enhance safety and mobility, enabling drivers to continue traveling a limited distance after a tire puncture.</p></p>
