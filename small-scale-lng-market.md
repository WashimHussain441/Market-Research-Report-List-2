<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small-Scale LNG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction Terminal</li><li>Regasification Terminal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The small-scale LNG market encompasses two primary types: liquefaction terminals and regasification terminals. Liquefaction terminals convert natural gas into liquid form for easier transport and storage, primarily serving remote or small-scale demands. Conversely, regasification terminals are facilities that receive LNG shipments and convert it back into gas for distribution to local markets. Both terminal types play crucial roles in expanding access to natural gas, enhancing energy security, and supporting regional energy transition efforts with flexible supply options.</p></p>
