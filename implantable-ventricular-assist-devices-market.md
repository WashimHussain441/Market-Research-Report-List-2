<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Ventricular Assist Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LVADs</li><li>RVADs</li><li>BIVADs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The implantable ventricular assist devices market is categorized into three main types: Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs), Right Ventricular Assist Devices (RVADs), and Biventricular Assist Devices (BIVADs). LVADs support the left ventricle, primarily aiding patients with heart failure. RVADs assist the right ventricle and are often used in conjunction with LVADs in severe cases. BIVADs provide support to both ventricles simultaneously, used when both sides of the heart require assistance, enhancing overall cardiac function.</p></p>
